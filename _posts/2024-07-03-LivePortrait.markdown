We propose a video-driven portrait animation framework named <strong>LivePortrait</strong> with a focus on better generalization, controllability, and efficiency for practical usage. The generation speed remarkably reaches <strong>12.8ms</strong> on an RTX 4090 GPU with PyTorch. The inference code and models are available at <strong>https://github.com/KwaiVGI/LivePortrait</strong>.
